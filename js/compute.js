    var  tip = ["<h1>Getting Started</h1><p>This the most important step, prayer is made over the site... This may seem funny but it helps to have someone to blame if things don't go well. You may want to build a shed (strong room and store) where people can take a break or workers can hide from harsh weather conditions and where the building materials will be placed till it is needed. Then, the site is cleared of any bush and graded to remove the top soil and give the site a building site look and feel. Also have in mind that any close tree could still have it's roots in the site and affect the work. We may also agree that thing like accessibility conditions should be put into place. If possible, build a road that will allow supplies to be dellivered to you. <br><strong>Fix the drainage system</strong> <br>Flowing water can disrupt the work in progress (esp. for flood prone areas) so endeavour to make absolutely sure that gutters are dug in the reasonably rational positions with respect to your building site.</p><h3>Get an Architect to Draw a nice plan for you and the rest is simple</h3><img class='guideImg' title='site'src=\"img/site.jpg\"/>&nbsp&nbsp<img class='guideImg' title='sample plan'src=\"img/plan.gif\"/>",
                "<h1>Pegging</h1><p>Please before you start this phase, ensure that you have all legal rights (both constitutional and unconstitutional). <em><strong>We will be needing an engineer. </strong></em>After all has been done as specified in step 1, let the building begin. The planting of wooden pegs to define the area. It is worthy of note that the pegs do not define rooms or any other thing and it is set to give the expexted building some space, if you know what i mean. It is also used to prevent the elements and animals as well as humans not to trespass into the invisible house. It's started, so no going back or people are gonna gossip</p><img class='guideImg' title='pegging' src='img/pegging.gif'>",
                "<h1>Foundation</h1><p><em><strong>We will be needing plenty of strong hands and maisons as well. </strong></em>After pegging you are expected to start digging the foundation of the house. The engineer may also serve as the quality control manager, or otherwise check out our<a href='stats.html#quantity'> cost analysis section</a> to see how deep. Always remember that the strength of the foundation is determined by what you want to build above it.</p> <img class='guideImg' title='foundation' src='img/foundation.jpg'> ",
                "<h1>DPC level</h1><p>This is where we must have finished the foundation.the Damp Proof Course is used to prevent water from the earth from being absorbed from the blocks below the ground. It is not applied in some buildings and these building you'l notice will have the paint peeling off towards the lower side. DPC looks like plaster or better still bitumen, it may be applied onto the walls from the foundation trenches till when the ground level is passed by a few feet depending on the moistness of the site's soil.</p><img class='guideImg' title='Damp Proof Course' src='img/dpc1.jpg'>&nbsp&nbsp<img class='guideImg' title='Damp Proof Course' src='img/dpc2.jpg'>",
               
                "<h1>Block Work</h1><p>The block work is the part that gives plenty of joy clearly because you see where your money is going. Don't be shocked at how much you may have spent already or rather buried inside the ground. You'l be appreciating the money spent in some years to come when other houses start falling apart from old age. The most important thig to note here is that the mortar is the strength of block work and therefore even if the blocks are weak, ensure that the mortar (cement and sand mixture used for holding  or chucking the blocks together) is strong. </p><img class='guideImg' title='Block Work' src='img/block.jpg'>",
               
                "<h1>Lintel</h1><p>The lintel as we already know is the part that takes care of the holding of walls above the windows. it may be chain lintel i.e. the type that runs through all the walls in the building or the type that just runs some length above the windows and doors used especially in bungalows. as you would expect, I'd advice anybody to use the chain lintel type because it makes the house a lot stronger. the lintel is reinforced with iron rods and the concrete is made last some time before extra blocks are laid on it. The width of the pilars, lintel and beams will depend completely on the size of the block used. </p><img class='guideImg' title='Lintel' src='img/lintel.jpg'>", 
                
                "<h1>Roofing</h1><p>Roofing can be done immediately the block work is over. but then my advise is to allow a rest period of at least two weeks in rainy season and one month in dry season. This is done in order to allow for rain to water the job and complete the strengthening of the mortar used and the blocks. Remember that this whole work we have done is trying to create a rock out of quicklime in the cement used and we know that the reaction takes quite some time to complete and water is a catalyst for hardening the concrete and mortar used. The roofing can only be done after we are sure the block work is ready to carry the load.</p><p>The roof can be done with either metal or wood rafters, although metal is stronger, wood is better for high rising buildings and habitations and more cos effective.<br>The choice of the type of roofing sheet is also tantamount. you can either use zinc-coated corrugated roofing sheet or aluminium coated long span roofing sheet.</p><img class='guideImg' title='Great Roof' src='img/roof1.jpg'>&nbsp&nbsp<img class='guideImg' title='Colourful Roof' src='img/roof2.jpg'>", 
                "<h1>Decking</h1><p><h1>Wooden Deck</h1><br>Wooden decks are used especially on ground floor veranders or in places that do not require much strength or do not carry very heavy loads and are not critical areas in the house. In this type of Deck, the deck is created with wooden boards nailed side by side onto timber bars and held in place by pillars which would be either metal poles, wooden bars or concrete beams.<br><h1>Concrete Deck</h1><br>The concrete deck is just a slab of reinforced concrete which is supported by concrete beams. It is used when you intend to add extra storeys on top of the deck e.g. 2-storey buildings. The iron rods are packed in a cross-hatch pattern with tight density, spacing is normally 15cm.</p><img class='guideImg' title='Wooden Deck' src='img/woodenDeck.jpg'>&nbsp&nbsp<img class='guideImg' title='Councrete Deck' src='img/concrete.jpg'>", 
                "<h1>Balusters</h1><p>Balusters are used for support. They are installed in stair cases for hand rail, and at veranders and other such places. They are also used to decorate several places and other parts of the house. When moulded into some shapes, it could be used to created for use as window seals, and pilar covers and edge decoration. the balustered are painted to give the house a nice feel.</p><img class='guideImg' title='Wooden Balusters' src='img/woodenbaluster.jpg'>&nbsp&nbsp<img class='guideImg' title='Concrete Baluster' src='img/Baloster.jpg'>",
                "<h1>Plastering</h1><p>Plastering is noemally used to cover all the errors of made during the course of the pre-plastering processes. All holes, cracks, broken parts of the block work are covered with the mortar used for platering. There is a dedicated sand for plastering houses, it is informally referred to as cement sand. The cement sand is characterised by tiny grains of sand which are clearly finer than the sharp sand which has been used for most other work. The plastering is done only after the door frames and window frames have been inserted especially for wooden windows and doors or glass windows. The frames are then dressed with mortar and smootened to give it a nice look. After plastering, the building is almost ready.</p><img class='guideImg' title='Plastered' src='img/plastering.jpg'>",
                "<h1>Floor Finish</h1><p>Normally, people would use cement screed as floor finish and put a carpet or rug over it, this is good and economic practice but cement screed does not look beautiful especially if there is not enough means to purchase high quality carpet or floor rug. Therefore, on the long run, using nice finishing like tiles or marble or terrazo is always more preferable. The tiles have very beautiful decorations on them and most of them are smooth and shiny. If arranged well by experts, the tiles provide a powerful and pretty feel. Marbles are expensive and extra smooth, naturally, they are the best bet for big luxury building. They have the best look and feel. For stress areas, Terazzo is most preferable although it is slightly rough.</p><img class='guideImg' title='Tiles' src='img/tile.jpg'>&nbsp&nbsp<img class='guideImg' title='Marbles' src='img/marble.jpg'>", 
                "<h1>Plumbing Fittings</h1><p>Plumbing fittings would include everything that affects drainage. Both the methods of channeling water into the house and draining waste water to and from the sink, the shower, the tap, the wash hand basin and the WC (Water Closet). There may be need to install a water bore hole pump system with big tanks hung at hieghts above the ground such that the water would have enough pressure to flow into the house. Let me say as quickly as possible that a plumber is a very important personnel in this phase.</p><img class='guideImg' title='Plumbing' src='img/plumbing.jpg'>", 
                "<h1>Electrical Fittings</h1><p>This step can run concurrently with plumbing and floor finish. The electrician is the active component of the staff of this work. the electric fittings are installed and wired which will include lamps, lamp holders, switches, cieling roses, junction boxes, control switches, fuses, electric meters and so on. The light may also be tapped into the house in this phase of the work. If the wiring is conduit ( i.e. embedded within the walls) then the plan should already have the piped holes ready, else, it will have to be surface wiring using truncking or just clips. Using clips is messy and dirty but using truncking is neat job.  </p><img class='guideImg' title='Control Box' src='img/electric.jpg'>",
                "<h1>Painting</h1><p>This step happens only when the doors, buglary proof as well as windows have been installed.<strong> A painter is needed here</strong> The choice of colours is very important if you will love the fruit of all your efforts these past period of the building project. If wrong colors are chosen for a house, it will destroy the beauty. if bright colours are chosen, you will want to repaint the house often because walls must get dirty, one way or the other. Parts like the kitchen, toilet and bathroom should be painted with dull colours because they easily get dirty. Lets just say that the colours used should match or at least contrast well together. Naturally, a woman should do the selection since they are better with colours and have a greater sense of beauty. the parts closer to the ground can be painted with a darker colour while the top parts are painted bright colours.</p><img class='guideImg' title='Painting' src='img/Painting.jpg'>",
                "<h1>Aesthetics of Coumpound</h1><p>The painting makes the house look complete bu it can not be envisaged as a habitable home if the compund is not fixed. Hence, adding gardens, trees, lawns, landscaping, interlocking, taring, flower, and so many other things that will make the environment habitable. </p><img class='guideImg' title='Nice Compound' src='img/cpd1.jpg'>&nbsp&nbsp<img class='guideImg' title='Lawns' src='img/cpd2.jpg'>",
                "<h1>Interior Decoration</h1><p>This is the piont where stuff like curtains, and decorative fittings and materials are installed on the building internally. Upholstery, cussion, dinning table, and other things, other pieces of furniture may be installed in this phase. An interior decorator is employed. </p><img class='guideImg' title='Interior Decoration' src='img/house.jpg'>",
                "<h1>Prime Cost</h1><p>This is where finishing touches and miscelleneous properties are installed in the building. This step may not be considered as important if you are a Mahatma Ghandist and believe that took much confort is not good. it includes mirrors, fancy lights, and other vainities.</p><img class='guideImg' title='Vainities' src='img/parlor.jpg'>&nbsp&nbsp<img class='guideImg' title='Vainities' src='img/cpd.jpg'>"
